Anthony is the sprint leader, he gave us our tasks for the sprint while I started working out how to make it so that only the creator of the listing could edit it.
<br>
Added the userID to the listing so that later I can use that to edit it as that logged in user.

<h2>
Overall individual sprint reflection
</h2>
<br>
<br>
What did I do well? - only thing I did was recreate the forms and add a piece of code to grab the userID. 
<br>
What could I do better? - Lost motivation during this Sprint, was away for the majority of it. I'm going to try alot harder next Sprint.
<br>
What did I learn? - how to get the UserID of the user that added an item.
<br>
What do I still need to learn? - I need to learn how to use the userID to make it so that only one person can edit a listing.
<br>
<br>
<h2>
What the group achieved.
</h2>
<br>
I added the field for userID to start making the edit the listing by the user. Updated forms. Personally was busy with family and work during the second week of the, couldnt find any time to work on the project.

This sprint the whole group really struggled with the fifth agile principle, "Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done."
I think that the reason I personally struggled with this was because the group didn't show up and I had to decide on parts that I could work on alone.
I also think that had we followed the 12th principle, "At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly." We could have reflected on our motivation issues to progress together as a group.
