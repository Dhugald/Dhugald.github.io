Deployed the site, managed to find the merge errors with help from Adon. My goals this week are to re-write the routes in order to keep many of the pages cleaner and easier to follow.

Sometime in the morning
<br>
Spent time re-writing the Routes, there are issues with passing through ID's from the web.php to the controller, I want to work this out during the week.

Grayson has purchased Adons business and decided that we dont need to make a games site anymore, we are now making a car site. I need to rewrite the user stories, as a group we decided that we would get rid of the Games and Group pages and remake one of them as the Cars. I'm going to learn about resource groups for the routes and the CRUD apps.

8am-10am
<br>
I worked on making the CRUD app, I got the CR done and will work on the UD when I have time in the weekend. Laravel had an update that had broken routes and layouts we will need to fix our site next Sprint.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>
Overall individual sprint reflection
</h2>
<br>
<br>
What did I do well? - rewriting the routes using controllers to clean the code up. Also did well working out the start of the CRUD part of the app
<br>
What could I do better? - more sleep, not spilling coffee on myself and working harder to get the task done
<br>
What did I learn? - Learnt how to start the CRUD app and how to use controllers efficiently.
<br>
What do I still need to learn? - For the app I need to learn how to use the CRUD part effectively. Personally I need to learn how to hold a cup of coffee.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>
What the group achieved.
</h2>
<br>
As a group we managed to make a start on creating the page into a car site, most of the work was easily transferable. The parts that werent we were able to scrap and start fresh.
The group and I did a good job of making our code more effiecent and easier to follow from an outside perspective.
When deploying last sprints project Adon helped me find alot of merge errors so as a group we had a look over how to avoid the problem in the future.
<br>
<br>
<h2>
Agile Principles.
</h2>
<br>
During this third sprint We had to focus on the second Agile principle, "Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage."
A principle I personally could look into more is the 10th, "Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential." I spent alot of time reworking routes when I could have spent time doing more worl that would effect the front end of the site.
