Sprint 4, I'm leader This sprint the goal is to get the database properly connected to the site, I need to properly implement CRUD to the cars database and be able to get data from the other databases.

Taylor and Anthony need to create pages to display the outputted data.

Today I managed to link the project and the databases correctly, I was able to output the car, model and make of the manually added entry, Next I want to be able to add and display more items.

Out of class time

I finished the CRUD for the cars table so that next week we would be able to add more models to display on the pages that Ant and Taylor made.

8am – 10am
<br>
All the pages linked correctly, data is being displayed. We need to remove links from the old site that are no longer needed, we need to display the pages better like the forms to add a car or edit the car.

<h2>
Overall individual sprint reflection
</h2>
<br>
<br>
What did I do well? - Posting to the database and getting data from the database using CRUD.
<br>
What could I do better? - add more options to the cars, work out how to get.
<br>
What did I learn? - I learnt how to correctly implement CRUD using a resource controller in laravel.
<br>
What do I still need to learn? - I need to learn how to display the data effectively.
<br>
<h2>
What the group achieved.
</h2>
<br>
As a group we managed to add data to a database properly using CRUD and a resource controller, Taylor and Ant made basic pages to start displaying data in a practical way.
<br>
I feel that as a group we are doing less and less each sprint and I'm struggling to work out where we can improve and get motivation back up.
