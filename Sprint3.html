Deployed the site, managed to find the merge errors with help from Adon. My goals this week are to re-write the routes in order to keep many of the pages cleaner and easier to follow.

Grayson has purchased Adons business and decided that we dont need to make a games site anymore, we are now making a car site. I need to rewrite the user stories, as a group we decided that we would get rid of the Games and Group pages and remake one of them as the Cars. I'm going to learn about resource groups for the routes and the CRUD apps.

I worked on making the CRUD app, I got the CR done and will work on the UD when I have time in the weekend. Laravel had an update that had broken routes and layouts we will need to fix our site next Sprint.
