Dales day, we worked on recreating our site in order to include proper login auth rather than having to add all the code into our old site.
I need to find out more on the laravel created auth login and register forms.

<br>
weekend 29-31/08/2020
<br>
Merged the sprint branch to master, tried to deploy to the mariadb but found many merge errors proventing this, in the future as a group we need to check these merges so that we dont get this again.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>
Overall individual sprint reflection
</h2>
<br>
<br>
What did I do well? - Working out how to deploy the site to MariaDB
<br>
What could I do better? - Next time I wont deploy the site from my laptop as it took much longer than it would have from the polytech, I also want to check the merges more thoroughly.
<br>
What did I learn? - Laravel has very helpful features to help with users and pages.
<br>
What do I still need to learn? - I need to learn how to take advantage of these features that Laravel has, such as the login and users.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>
What the group achieved.
</h2>
<br>
As a group we restarted our site to begin to implement login and user creation properly using the laravel auth. 
<br>
<br>
<h2>
Agile Principles.
</h2>
<br>
This sprints main principle was the 9th, "Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility." having found a way that I could implemnent a auth in a more efficient manor using the laravel feature.
We also kept concerntration on the 7th principle, "Working software is the primary measure of progress.", my job on final day of the sprint was to get the site deployed to MariaDB so that we had something to show the client but there were some unresolved merge errors that prevented me from doing so.
