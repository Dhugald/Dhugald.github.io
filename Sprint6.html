8am – 10am
<br>
Adon Gave me the idea to use a concept API for my images, Using unsplashed API I was able to set it up so that I could get an image displaying to the card for an entry, but I couldnt display on any of the other cards.
Another issue was that I was sending it Data from my Cars, such as the title and the model but all of the API queries were identical.
<br>
<br>
Out of class
<br>
    After a meeting with Adon I was able to fix the duplicate data, I also worked out how to display more than one piece of data with Adons help.

8am – 10am
<br>
Spent time working on the API Refining the searching term and trying to see what would give me back the most reliable data. 

Trying to get Anthony motivated to help the group has been an issue aswell, I've asked him to layout and edit his cards for the listings.

8am – 10am
<br>
Having found a reliable search term to give me images of mainly car images I want to spend time on adding features to the site to help with giving users information.
Still trying to get Anthony motivated, Taylor will help with adding features.
<br>
<br>

<br>
8am – 10am
<br>
Taylor and I spent time Styling and adding the features we found on the example site. Taylor added the latest listings for the newest 5 vehicles added while I spent some time adding a news area and changing padding.
<br>

<br>
After days of pestering Anthony into doing work he changed one line of code to make the body type sliders slightly transparent, Still trying to get him to edit his cards.
Taylor and I spent time laying out stuff and making the styling slightly more attractive. 
<br>
<img src="/assets/img/AntsChange.png" alt="" Style="Width:400px; height:200px">
<br>
<br>

<br>
Decided that getting Anthony to contribute to the styling was a lost cause. 
Taylor and I finished fixing the site by styling cards and adding a footer, we tweaked some small CSS parts but we have alot of stuff we could have improved on.

<h2>Overall individual sprint reflection</h2>
<br>
<br>

What did I do well? - Keeping calm when trying to get a group member to contribute to the project, I also feel that I progressed with my ability to use styles in a attractive manor.
<br>
What could I do better? - On future projects I would learn how to effectively use the layout feature to display data such as using a layout for the cards.
<br>
What did I learn? - I learnt the struggle of motivating a group member that has put his mind to a different task
<br>
What do I still need to learn? - For future Laravel projects I need to learn how to effectively use the features within the framework.
<br>
<br>

<h2>
What the group achieved.
</h2>
<br>

As a group we didn't achieve alot, but Taylor and I were able to add some basic features for the user interface and create styles that we found appealing.
I was able to get my image API working and Taylor was able to get his features working.

<br>
<br>
<h2>
Agile Principles.
</h2>
<br>
<img src="/assets/img/Ant3.jpg" alt=""  style="size: 5%;">
<br>
Again this sprint we had issues with the fifth Agile principle, "Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done."
I had spent most of my time struggling to get a group member to help with work as he had lost motivation.
Taylor and I worked 11th and the 4th agile principles, the 11th, "The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams." and the 4th "Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project."
We made a plan of what we wanted to achieve during the sprint and we completed our goals during the sprint by working on them most days during the 2 weeks.
